# DevTools Access Requests

## Getting Started
Welcome. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the onboarding process for new users to the project. These steps detail how an employee will send a request and how we will acknowledge the ticket. We will be able to validate the specific repositories the user has requested. Once this is done, we can add the user to our tracking page, AWS SSO via Terraform, and find the newly joined user via the GitHub SBA-ULP People. Once this is done, we will add the user to the relevant team based on their desired repository access request. The user will get an email to let them know they have been added to the team and we will mark ticket as done.
